# cyber-chat

    a web chat application, with some basic chat functionality for people like HackerMan üë®‚Äçüíª
Live at: [cyber-chat](https://cyber-chat.herokuapp.com)

I made this app because my IP Messenger was not working and I had to send my friends some important nuclear codes. User can set a nickname and communicate with other connected clients. Can extend this app to show the online users.

Made using web socket sever and deployed using heroku.

A simple node app which a noob can understand.
